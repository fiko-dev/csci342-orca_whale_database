Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest animals on Earth, occasionally grace the waters of the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as they migrate through the region. These massive creatures, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weighing as much as 200 tons, are known for their distinctive mottled blue-gray coloration. While not as common in the PNW as in some other areas, they can be spotted in offshore waters during their seasonal migration. The region serves as part of their feeding grounds in the summer and fall, emphasizing the significance of the PNW in the conservation efforts for these magnificent cetaceans.</p>
