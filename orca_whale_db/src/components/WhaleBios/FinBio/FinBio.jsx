Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), the second-largest whales globally, are occasionally spotted in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) during their migratory journeys. Recognizable by their sleek, streamlined bodies and asymmetrical coloration, fin whales undertake long migrations, and the PNW serves as part of their route. Although not as commonly observed as some other whale species in the region, their presence highlights the diverse marine ecosystem. Fin whales are known to feed on small schooling fish, and efforts are ongoing to monitor and protect these majestic creatures in the Pacific Northwest waters, contributing to the broader understanding of their behavior and promoting conservation measures.</p>
