                    Gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are iconic inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest (PNW), recognized for their mottled gray appearance and extraordinary migration. These whales embark on one of the longest mammalian migrations, traveling between their Arctic feeding grounds and Baja California breeding and calving lagoons. In the PNW, they are frequently observed during their spring and fall migrations, offering a captivating spectacle for whale watchers along the coastline. Conservation efforts in the region focus on understanding and safeguarding gray whales, addressing concerns such as entanglement in fishing gear and the impacts of environmental changes on their migratory routes.</p>
