                    Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are a frequent and captivating presence in the waters of the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Known for their acrobatic behavior, distinctively long pectoral fins, and haunting songs, humpback whales migrate through the region seasonally. They visit the PNW during the summer and fall, attracted by the abundance of prey such as small fish and krill. These charismatic whales are often observed breaching and tail-slapping, adding a captivating spectacle to the rich marine environment of the Pacific Northwest. Conservation efforts in the PNW aim to protect and understand the behavior of humpback whales, contributing to the broader appreciation and stewardship of marine biodiversity in the region.</p>
