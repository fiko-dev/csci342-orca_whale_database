                    <p>The Pacific Northwest is home to diverse orcas, each with unique eco-types. Resident Orcas, known for familial bonds, mainly eat salmon and inhabit specific regions. Transient Orcas, preferring marine mammals, lead nomadic lives in smaller, less stable groups. Offshore Orcas, less studied, inhabit deeper waters with a broader diet. These orca variations highlight adaptability to different environments. Conservation is crucial due to challenges like declining salmon, pollution, and vessel noise, impacting their health in the rich PNW ecosystems.</p>
